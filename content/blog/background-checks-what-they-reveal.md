## Criminal History and Court Records

One of the most common reasons for background checks is verifying criminal history. Professional background investigations search multiple databases and court records to uncover felony and misdemeanor convictions, arrests and pending charges, sex offender registry status, restraining orders or protective orders, civil judgments and lawsuits, and bankruptcy filings. It's important to note that criminal records vary by jurisdiction. A thorough investigation searches federal, state, and county records, as people may have records in multiple locations. Free online searches often miss crucial information that comprehensive professional searches reveal.

## Employment and Education Verification

Resume fraud is surprisingly common. Professional background checks verify the accuracy of claimed credentials including employment history, dates, and positions held, educational degrees and institutions attended, professional licenses and certifications, military service records, and professional references. Studies show that a significant percentage of resumes contain false or exaggerated information. Verification protects you from hiring or partnering with someone based on fraudulent credentials.

## Financial Background

Financial history can be relevant for various reasons, especially in business contexts. Background investigations can reveal credit history (when legally permissible), bankruptcy filings, tax liens and judgments, property ownership and mortgage records, and business affiliations and ownership. While not all situations require financial investigation, it's particularly relevant when considering business partners, executives handling company finances, individuals in positions of financial trust, or tenants for rental properties.

## Personal and Social Media Investigation

Digital footprints provide valuable insights into character and behavior. Modern background checks often include reviewing social media presence and public posts, online reviews or complaints, professional networking profiles, publicly available photos and videos, and news articles or public records. This isn't about invading privacy-it's about reviewing information people have chosen to make public. Often, social media reveals behavior that contradicts professional presentations or claimed character.

## Asset Searches

In certain situations, knowing someone's financial position is important. Asset searches can identify real estate holdings, vehicle registrations, business ownership interests, valuable personal property, and hidden assets. Asset searches are particularly relevant in divorce proceedings, business disputes, debt collection, and fraud investigations.

## License and Certification Verification

For professionals in regulated industries, license verification is crucial. Investigators verify professional licenses (medical, legal, real estate, etc.), certifications and accreditations, license status (active, suspended, revoked), disciplinary actions or complaints, and continuing education compliance. Never assume credentials are legitimate-verification ensures you're working with properly qualified individuals.

## When Background Checks Are Essential

Consider professional background investigations in these situations: before hiring employees (especially those working with vulnerable populations or handling finances), when selecting business partners, before entering serious personal relationships, when hiring household workers (nannies, caregivers, contractors), for tenant screening, when considering major financial transactions, before entering into significant contracts, and for due diligence in mergers or acquisitions. The cost of a background check is minimal compared to the potential cost of a bad decision.

## Legal Considerations and Fair Credit Reporting Act

Background checks must comply with various laws, particularly the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) for employment purposes. Proper consent and disclosure are required for employment background checks. Adverse action procedures must be followed if employment is denied based on background information. Information use must be limited to permissible purposes. Privacy rights must be respected. Professional investigators understand these requirements and ensure compliance, protecting you from legal liability while obtaining the information you need.

## The Limitations of Background Checks

Understanding what background checks can't do is as important as knowing what they can reveal. Not all criminal records appear in databases-records may be sealed, expunged, or in jurisdictions not searched. Social media accounts may be private or deleted. Some professional information requires direct verification that takes time. Not all past behavior leaves a documented trail. Setting realistic expectations helps you use background investigations appropriately. They're powerful tools, not crystal balls, and should be part of-not a replacement for-due diligence.
