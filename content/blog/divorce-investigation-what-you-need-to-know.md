## Infidelity Investigations

Suspicions of adultery are among the most common reasons people hire investigators during divorce. While Colorado is a no-fault divorce state (meaning you don't need to prove wrongdoing to divorce), evidence of infidelity can still impact proceedings in several ways. It may affect spousal support decisions, influence property division, and be relevant in custody determinations if the affair affected parenting. Professional investigators conduct discreet surveillance, document encounters, and provide court-admissible evidence. This evidence can provide the clarity you need to move forward, whether that means pursuing divorce or attempting reconciliation with full knowledge of the situation.

## Hidden Assets and Financial Investigations

Financial deception during divorce is more common than many realize. One spouse may hide assets, underreport income, or transfer property to relatives or business partners to avoid fair division. Private investigators specializing in financial investigations can trace hidden bank accounts, locate undisclosed property, uncover off-the-books income, and identify fraudulent transfers. These investigations often involve asset searches, business records analysis, lifestyle analysis (comparing claimed income to actual spending), and documentation of major purchases or transfers. Discovering hidden assets can significantly impact the divorce settlement, ensuring you receive your fair share of marital property.

## Child Custody Investigations

When children are involved, their wellbeing becomes the paramount concern. If you have legitimate concerns about your ex-spouse's parenting, lifestyle, or household environment, documentation is essential. Investigators can conduct discreet surveillance to document concerning behaviors such as substance abuse, neglect, unsafe living conditions, exposure to dangerous individuals, or violation of custody agreements. The court's primary consideration is the child's best interest, and professional documentation of concerning behavior can be crucial in custody decisions. It's important to note that investigations should focus on genuine safety and welfare concerns, not vindictive attempts to punish an ex-spouse.

## Lifestyle Investigations for Alimony Cases

Spousal support (alimony) decisions consider various factors, including each spouse's financial needs and ability to pay. If your spouse is claiming financial hardship while maintaining an expensive lifestyle, or if they're cohabiting with a new partner (which may affect alimony in some circumstances), documentation can be valuable. Investigators can document living arrangements, major purchases, employment status, and lifestyle patterns that may contradict claims made in court filings.

## Social Media and Digital Investigations

In today's digital age, social media and online activity often provide valuable evidence in divorce cases. However, accessing this information legally is important. Private investigators know how to conduct digital investigations within legal boundaries, documenting publicly available information, analyzing social media posts and check-ins, reviewing dating profiles, and examining digital financial records. What people post online often contradicts claims they make in divorce proceedings, making digital investigations increasingly valuable.

## Witness Location and Statement Collection

Sometimes divorce cases require locating witnesses who can provide testimony relevant to your case. Private investigators can locate former nannies, neighbors, or others who may have relevant information, interview witnesses and collect statements, and verify information provided by potential witnesses.

## What to Expect: The Investigation Process

Understanding the investigation process helps set realistic expectations. First, you'll have a confidential consultation where you discuss your concerns and goals. The investigator will develop an investigation plan with estimated timeline and costs. During active investigation, they'll conduct surveillance, research, and documentation as planned. You'll receive regular updates throughout the process. Finally, you'll receive a comprehensive report with evidence presented in a court-ready format. Professional investigators can also provide expert testimony if needed.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

It's crucial that all investigation activities remain legal and ethical. Professional investigators understand privacy laws, surveillance regulations, and evidence gathering rules. They know what can and cannot be legally obtained. Never attempt surveillance yourself or ask friends to do so-amateur efforts often cross legal lines, and resulting evidence may be inadmissible or could even create legal problems for you.
