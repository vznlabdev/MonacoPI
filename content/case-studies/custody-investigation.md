challenge: "A concerned mother contacted us regarding her ex-husband's fitness as a custodial parent. Following their divorce, he had begun a new relationship and moved his girlfriend into his home where their two young children spent alternating weeks. The mother had growing concerns about neglect, substance abuse, and her children's safety based on changes in their behavior and concerning statements they made after visitation. However, she had no concrete evidence to present to the family court, and feared that accusations without proof could backfire and damage her custody position. She needed professional documentation of the actual conditions and care her children were receiving."
outcome: "Our comprehensive investigation provided the family court with clear, documented evidence of inadequate supervision and concerning conditions during the father's custody periods. The investigation revealed a pattern of neglect including children left unsupervised for 3-5 hours on multiple occasions, the father's absence from the home during 60% of his custody time, substance use in the home while children were present, and failure to maintain consistent bedtimes, meals, and homework supervision. Based on our evidence and expert testimony, the court modified the custody arrangement to grant our client primary physical custody with the father receiving supervised visitation until he could demonstrate improved parenting capabilities. The court specifically cited our investigation's documentation in its ruling. Most importantly, the children were removed from an unsafe environment, and the mother gained peace of mind knowing her children were protected."
approach:
  - heading: "Discreet Surveillance Operations"
    description: "We conducted extensive surveillance during the father's custody periods, documenting daily routines, care patterns, and concerning behaviors. Our team observed and recorded the children being left alone for extended periods, the father's girlfriend performing all childcare while he was absent, and late-night parties with numerous guests while the children were present in the home."
  - heading: "Background Investigation"
    description: "We performed comprehensive background checks on the father's new girlfriend who was now living in the home with the children. The investigation revealed a criminal history including a prior DUI conviction and a drug possession charge that had been dismissed - information that had not been disclosed to our client or the court."
  - heading: "Neighborhood Canvas & Witness Interviews"
    description: "Our investigators discreetly interviewed neighbors and witnesses who had observed concerning incidents. We documented statements about loud parties, arguments, and one neighbor's account of finding the children playing unsupervised in the street. All witness statements were properly documented and witnesses were willing to provide testimony if needed."
  - heading: "Documentation & School Records"
    description: "We worked with the client's attorney to obtain school attendance records and teacher observations during the contested custody period. The records showed the children were frequently late or absent on days following the father's custody periods, and teachers noted they often appeared tired and hadn't completed homework."
