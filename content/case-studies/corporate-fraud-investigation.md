challenge: "A mid-sized tech company in Boulder noticed discrepancies in their accounts payable department - missing funds, duplicate vendor payments, and unexplained expenses. Initial internal audits suggested potential fraud, but the scope and parties involved remained unclear. The company's leadership needed to identify all perpetrators, recover stolen funds, and gather evidence sufficient for criminal prosecution - all while maintaining business operations and confidentiality to prevent destruction of evidence."
outcome: "Our investigation exposed a three-year fraud scheme involving four employees who had embezzled over $847,000 through fake vendors and manipulated invoices. The evidence we gathered - including financial records, surveillance documentation, digital communications, and witness statements - was presented to law enforcement. All four individuals were arrested and charged with felony theft and conspiracy. The company successfully recovered 94% of the stolen funds through asset seizures, restitution orders, and insurance claims. Additionally, our findings enabled the company to implement stronger internal controls and prevent future fraud. Three of the four defendants accepted plea agreements, and one case went to trial resulting in conviction. Our lead investigator provided expert testimony that was cited by the prosecutor as instrumental in securing the guilty verdict."
approach:
  - heading: "Covert Internal Investigation"
    description: "We initiated a discreet investigation without alerting potential suspects. This involved securing and analyzing financial records, email communications, and digital transactions. We worked after hours and maintained complete confidentiality to preserve the integrity of evidence and prevent suspects from covering their tracks."
  - heading: "Surveillance Operations"
    description: "Based on financial analysis pointing to specific employees, we conducted targeted surveillance to document lifestyle inconsistencies with legitimate income. This included monitoring one suspect's purchase of a luxury vehicle and another's down payment on a vacation property - both well beyond their salary range."
  - heading: "Digital Forensics & Communication Analysis"
    description: "Our digital forensics team recovered deleted emails and analyzed communication patterns between suspects. We uncovered a sophisticated scheme involving fake vendor accounts, invoice manipulation, and coordinated timing of fraudulent transactions. The digital evidence revealed the full scope of the conspiracy and the role of each participant."
  - heading: "Vendor Verification & External Investigation"
    description: "We investigated the supposed vendors receiving payments, discovering that several were shell companies with addresses at mail forwarding services. Bank account analysis revealed these accounts were controlled by the employees under investigation, confirming the fraudulent scheme."
